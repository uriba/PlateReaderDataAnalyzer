<p>
<H2>Welcome to the Plate Reader Data Analyzer site</H2>
The aim of this site is to facilitate the analysis of data measured using plate readers.
The site currently supports .xlsx files generated by Tecan readers.
</p>

<p>
The site implements algorithms to calculate growth rates and doubling times based on Optical Densitiy (OD) measurements.
Analysis of fluorescnet and luminescent reporter genes to deduce protein level, promoter activity and other related quantities is planned to be implemented as well.
</p>

<p>
To begin, upload a plate-reader generated file using the field at the left side of the page (<a href=/sample/sample.xlsx download>here</a> is a sample file to be used in case one is missing).
Once a file is uploaded, and according to the analysis type, various controls will appear on the left side of the page allowing adjustments of parameters for the analysis.
The main page (where currently this text is displayed) will present graphs showing the results of the analysis.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate analysis, the site supports uploading of plate layout file that allows labeling and grouping of wells by content.
A sample layout file can be downloaded <a href=/sample/layout.xlsx download>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
As plate reader data tends to be of high volume and complexity, the processing and display of data may take a few seconds, up to about a minute, to appear (for 96-well plates and ~ 100 measurements per well).
Focusing the analysis on specific rows, columns, or wells will reduce the amount of data processing, thus making the site speedier.
</p>

<p>
Future plans for the site include (by no particular order):
Analysis of various reporter genes related statistics, promoter activity, protein level etc.
Supporting wider variety of input files from different plate readers, upon request.
</p>

<p>
This site is developed by Uri Barenhols from Ron Milo's lab in the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel.
The code is availabe at <a href=http://github.com/uriba/PlateReaderDataAnalyzer> github </a>
