# Summary

This software enables the rapid calculation of growth rate of microorganisms based on optical density collected data by plate readers.
The online use of this software facilitates the calculation over other available tools such as [@Ram022640], [@grofit], [@curvefitter]
This is a proof of concept integration between a GitHub [@GitHub] repo and figshare [@figshare] in an effort to get a DOI for a GitHub repository. When a repository is tagged for release on GitHub, Fidgit [@Fidgit] will import the release into figshare thus giving the code bundle a DOI. In a somewhat meta fashion, Fidgit is publishing itself to figshare with DOI 'http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.828487' [@figshare_archive].
