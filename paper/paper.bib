                            abstract = {Fitness is not well estimated from growth curves of individual isolates in monoculture. Rather, competition experiments, which measure relative growth in mixed microbial cultures, must be performed to better infer relative fitness. However, competition experiments require unique genotypic or phenotypic markers, and thus are difficult to perform with isolates derived from a common ancestor or non-model organisms. Here we describe Curveball, a new computational approach for predicting relative growth of microbes in a mixed culture utilizing mono- and mixed culture growth curve data. We implemented Curveball in an open-source software package (http://curveball.yoavram.com) and validated the approach using growth curve and competition experiments with bacteria. Curveball provides a simpler and more cost-effective approach to predict relative growth and infer relative fitness. Furthermore, by integrating several growth phases into the fitness estimation, Curveball provides a holistic approach to fitness inference from growth curve data.},

    abstract = { The grofit package was developed to fit many growth curves obtained under different conditions in order to derive a conclusive dose-response curve, for instance for a compound that potentially affects growth. grofit fits data to different parametric models and in addition provides a model free spline method to circumvent systematic errors that might occur within application of parametric methods. This amendment increases the reliability of the characteristic parameters (e.g.,lag phase, maximal growth rate, stationary phase) derived from a single growth curve. By relating obtained parameters to the respective condition (e.g.,concentration of a compound) a dose response curve can be derived that enables the calculation of descriptive pharma-/toxicological values like half maximum effective concentration (EC50). Bootstrap and cross-validation techniques are used for estimating confidence intervals of all derived parameters.},
